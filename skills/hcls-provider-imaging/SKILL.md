# Healthcare Imaging Solutions on Snowflake

## Setup

1. **Load** `references/dicom-standards.md` for DICOM domain context
2. **Verify** Snowflake connection is active and target database/schema exist
3. **Run Preflight Check** for Data Model Knowledge (see below)

## Preflight Check (REQUIRED -- Run at Skill Load)

Before routing to any sub-skill, verify the DICOM Data Model Knowledge repository is available:

```sql
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
    'UNSTRUCTURED_HEALTHDATA.DATA_MODEL_KNOWLEDGE.DICOM_MODEL_SEARCH_SVC',
    '{"query": "test", "columns": ["CONTENT"], "limit": 1}'
);
```

| Result | Status | Behavior |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Returns results | READY | Step 0 (Data Model Knowledge pre-step) will use dynamic search results |
| Error / does not exist | MISSING | Step 0 skipped -- sub-skills fall back to hardcoded schema definitions from SKILL.md references. Inform user: "DICOM data model search service not available -- using hardcoded schemas" |

This preflight runs ONCE at router load. The result determines whether Step 0 below executes or is skipped.

## Intent Detection

| Intent | Triggers | Load |
|--------|----------|------|
| PARSE | "parse DICOM", "extract DICOM tags", "DICOM schema", "DICOM data model", "pydicom", "DICOM to Snowflake", "build DICOM tables" | `dicom-parser/SKILL.md` |
| INGEST | "ingest DICOM", "imaging pipeline", "load images", "PACS integration", "stage DICOM", "stream images", "dynamic table imaging" | `dicom-ingestion/SKILL.md` |
| ANALYTICS | "imaging analytics", "metadata extraction", "imaging search", "Cortex search imaging", "study analytics", "radiology NLP", "report extraction" | `dicom-analytics/SKILL.md` |
| VIEWER | "imaging viewer", "Streamlit imaging", "DICOM viewer", "imaging app", "imaging dashboard", "radiology UI", "deploy viewer" | `imaging-viewer/SKILL.md` |
| GOVERNANCE | "imaging governance", "HIPAA", "PHI masking", "imaging audit", "imaging classification", "imaging access policy", "de-identification" | `imaging-governance/SKILL.md` |
| ML | "imaging model", "train imaging", "imaging classification ML", "pathology model", "radiology AI", "deploy imaging model", "imaging inference" | `imaging-ml/SKILL.md` |
| MODEL_KNOWLEDGE | "data model reference", "DICOM schema lookup", "generate DDL from model", "what columns", "model repository", "PHI columns", "table relationships" | `data-model-knowledge/SKILL.md` |

## Data Model Knowledge — Automatic Pre-Step (Conditional on Preflight)

**CRITICAL:** For intents PARSE, INGEST, ANALYTICS, and GOVERNANCE, **execute Step 0 if preflight status is READY**. If preflight status is MISSING, skip Step 0 and let sub-skills use hardcoded schema definitions.

### Step 0: Query Data Model Knowledge (automatic for PARSE, INGEST, ANALYTICS, GOVERNANCE)

Before generating any DDL, building pipelines, creating analytics views, or applying governance policies:

1. **Query the DICOM model search service** for relevant tables/columns:
```sql
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
    'UNSTRUCTURED_HEALTHDATA.DATA_MODEL_KNOWLEDGE.DICOM_MODEL_SEARCH_SVC',
    '{"query": "<context from user request>", "columns": ["table_name", "column_name", "data_type", "constraints", "description", "dicom_tag", "contains_phi", "relationships"]}'
);
```

2. **Use the search results** — not hardcoded DDL — as the source of truth for:
   - Table names and column definitions (PARSE, INGEST)
   - Column types and DICOM tag mappings (INGEST, ANALYTICS)
   - PHI column identification (GOVERNANCE)
   - Foreign key relationships (all)

3. **Pass results to the sub-skill** as grounding context.

| Intent | Step 0 Query Focus | What Gets Grounded |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|
| PARSE | All tables + columns for requested scope | CREATE TABLE DDL statements |
| INGEST | Target table columns + data types + relationships | COPY INTO mappings, Dynamic Table SELECT lists |
| ANALYTICS | Source table columns + descriptions | Analytical views, Cortex AI extraction prompts |
| GOVERNANCE | PHI-flagged columns across all tables | Masking policy targets, de-identification scope |

  +---> PARSE -----> dicom-parser/SKILL.md (DDL grounded by search results OR hardcoded)
  |
  +---> INGEST ----> dicom-ingestion/SKILL.md (pipelines grounded by search results OR hardcoded)
  |
  +---> ANALYTICS -> dicom-analytics/SKILL.md (views grounded by search results OR hardcoded)
  |
  +---> GOVERNANCE > imaging-governance/SKILL.md (PHI columns from search results OR hardcoded)
  |
  +---> VIEWER ----> imaging-viewer/SKILL.md
  |
  +---> ML --------> imaging-ml/SKILL.md
  |
  +---> MODEL_KNOWLEDGE -> data-model-knowledge/SKILL.md (direct search queries)
```

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

All sub-skills should apply these platform patterns:

- **Data Model Knowledge (Preflight-Conditional Pre-Step)**: For PARSE, INGEST, ANALYTICS, and GOVERNANCE intents, the router **runs a preflight check** on `DICOM_MODEL_SEARCH_SVC`. If READY, it queries the Cortex Search Service before loading the sub-skill to ground all schema-dependent work in the latest data model. If MISSING, sub-skills fall back to hardcoded DDL from their SKILL.md references.
- **DICOM Parsing**: The `dicom-parser` sub-skill contains a comprehensive 18-table DICOM data model and a pydicom-based parser script. Use it as the foundation before ingestion or analytics.
- **Data Engineering**: Dynamic Tables for incremental refresh, Streams/Tasks for event-driven pipelines
- **AI/ML**: Cortex AI functions (COMPLETE, EXTRACT, SENTIMENT), Cortex Search for imaging metadata, ML Registry for models
- **Apps**: Streamlit in Snowflake for dashboards, SPCS for compute-heavy imaging workloads
- **Security**: Data masking for PHI, row-access policies per role, SYSTEM$CLASSIFY for PII detection, audit trails via ACCESS_HISTORY

## Stopping Points

- After intent detection if ambiguous
- Before creating any database objects
- Before deploying apps or models
