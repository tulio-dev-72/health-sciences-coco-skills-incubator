# Industry Solutions Architect for Health Sciences

An **Industry Solutions Architect** is a composable skill-based system on [Cortex Code](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cortex-code/cortex-code) that builds end-to-end healthcare and life sciences data and AI pipelines on Snowflake — delivering business outcomes from a single natural language conversation.

Instead of writing boilerplate pipelines from scratch, a solutions architect describes the business problem. An orchestrator agent understands the healthcare domain, selects the right combination of industry skills and Snowflake platform capabilities, and composes them into a working solution — from data ingestion through governance to analytics and applications.

### What makes this different

- **Composable skills, not monolithic scripts.** Each skill encodes deep domain expertise (DICOM imaging, FHIR interoperability, FAERS pharmacovigilance, genomics pipelines, claims analytics) as a reusable building block.
- **Orchestrator-driven composition.** A single orchestrator agent detects intent, routes across healthcare business domains, and chains multiple skills together with Snowflake platform skills to deliver complete solutions.
- **Knowledge-grounded.** Cortex Knowledge Extensions (CKEs) provide on-demand RAG search over PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov. A Data Model Knowledge repository grounds schema generation in live reference models via Cortex Search.
- **Governance by default.** HIPAA guardrails — PHI masking, row-access policies, audit trails, de-identification — are enforced as cross-cutting concerns across every workflow.
- **Scales like lego blocks.** New skills snap into the framework as independent building blocks. Router skills cluster related capabilities under a business function (e.g., imaging router with parse/ingest/analytics/governance sub-skills). Adding a new domain or business function is just adding another skill directory — the orchestrator picks it up automatically.

### Example

A user asks:

> *"Design a Phase III clinical trial for a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist targeting Type 2 Diabetes with cardiovascular outcome endpoints."*

The orchestrator automatically composes multiple skills into a solution chain: research problem validation → competitor trial search (ClinicalTrials.gov CKE) → literature review (PubMed CKE) → protocol generation → survival endpoint design → claims-based feasibility analysis. No skill names needed.

```

**How it works:**

1. User describes a healthcare business problem in natural language
2. Orchestrator detects the domain from trigger keywords and context
3. One or more industry skills are selected and composed into a plan
4. Platform skills are added based on each skill's declared **platform affinities** (e.g., `data-governance` when PHI is present, `dynamic-tables` for ongoing feeds)
5. **The plan is presented to the user for approval before execution** (mandatory Plan-then-Execute gate)
6. Skills invoke Snowflake platform skills for infrastructure (Dynamic Tables, Cortex AI, Streamlit, etc.)
7. For schema-dependent tasks, Data Model Knowledge auto-fires to ground outputs in live reference models
8. CKEs are invoked on-demand when literature or trial evidence adds value
9. HIPAA governance guardrails are applied across all workflows

### How the Pieces Fit Together

Before diving in, it helps to understand the two configuration layers that connect the repo to Cortex Code:

| Layer | File | What It Does |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Profile config** | `~/.snowflake/cortex/profiles/health-sciences-incubator.json` | Points Cortex Code to the orchestrator system prompt (via GitHub `systemPromptRepo`) and declares the GitHub skill repo. Skills are **scoped to this profile only** — they don't pollute the global `skills.json`. |
| **Orchestrator agent** | `agents/health-sciences-incubator.md` (in this repo) | The system prompt with routing rules, skill taxonomy, and HIPAA guardrails. Fetched automatically from GitHub via `systemPromptRepo` in the profile config. No local copy needed. |

> **Key design choice:** Skills are declared inside the profile via `skillRepos` with a GitHub source, not registered globally via `cortex skill add`. This keeps the HCLS skills isolated to the incubator profile and avoids conflicts with other profiles.

The steps below wire these up end-to-end. **No local clone is required.**

### Step 1: Create the Profile

The profile tells Cortex Code to use the orchestrator agent as its system prompt (fetched directly from GitHub) **and** declares the GitHub skill repo. Both the orchestrator and skills are fetched automatically — no local files to manage.

> **Note:** The `~/.snowflake/cortex/profiles/` directory is created automatically during Cortex Code installation. The `mkdir -p` below is a safe no-op if it already exists.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.snowflake/cortex/profiles

cat > ~/.snowflake/cortex/profiles/health-sciences-incubator.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "health-sciences-incubator",
  "description": "Industry Solutions Architect for Health Sciences on Snowflake",
  "systemPromptRepo": {
    "source": "github:Snowflake-Solutions/health-sciences-coco-skills-incubator/agents/health-sciences-incubator.md",
    "ref": "main"
  },
  "skillRepos": [
    {
      "source": "github:Snowflake-Solutions/health-sciences-coco-skills-incubator/skills",
      "ref": "main"
    }
  ],
  "mcpServers": {},
  "commandRepos": [],
  "hooks": null,
  "envVars": {},
  "settingsOverrides": {}
}
EOF
```

> **How `systemPromptRepo` works:** The `source` field uses `github:<org>/<repo>/<path>` format to point directly at the orchestrator markdown file in the GitHub repo. The `ref` field specifies the branch. Cortex Code fetches the system prompt into a local cache automatically — no manual download or `<HOME>` path substitution needed.

> **How `skillRepos` works:** Same format as `systemPromptRepo` — points at the `skills/` directory in the GitHub repo. Cortex Code clones the skills into a local cache automatically — no manual `cortex skill add` needed.

> **Note:** Some skills (like `clinical-docs`) reference `AGENTS.md` for session-level guardrails and `hooks.json` for hard blocks on DDL/DML. These are optional but recommended for production use — see the [Defense-in-Depth](#defense-in-depth-clinical-docs) section.

### Step 2: Launch with the Profile

Start Cortex Code with the orchestrator profile:

```bash
cortex --profile health-sciences-incubator
```

The `--profile` flag loads the orchestrator agent as the system prompt and fetches the 20 `hcls-*` skills from GitHub into a local cache. On first launch this involves a sparse Git clone; subsequent launches use the cached copy.

### Step 3: Validate

Inside the Cortex Code session, verify everything is wired correctly:

```
/skill                    # Should list 20 hcls-* skills
/agents                   # Should show health-sciences-incubator as active
```

From a separate terminal:

```bash
cortex profile show health-sciences-incubator  # Should show Skills (1 repos) with GitHub source
cortex profile list                            # Verify profile exists
```

### Step 4: Optional Dependencies

**Cortex Knowledge Extensions (CKEs):** Install PubMed and/or Clinical Trials CKE from Snowflake Marketplace for literature/trial evidence grounding. Skills work without CKEs but provide richer results with them.

**Data Model Knowledge:** Run `scripts/setup_dicom_model_knowledge_repo.sql` to create the Cortex Search Service over the DICOM data model.

### Step 5: Start Using

Ask healthcare questions in natural language. The orchestrator follows a **Plan-then-Execute** protocol: it builds a solution plan showing which skills and platform capabilities will be used, presents it for your approval, and only then executes. For simple single-skill queries the gate is lightweight; for multi-step pipelines you'll see the full numbered plan.

```
"I have DICOM files from our radiology department on S3.
 Build a pipeline to parse, ingest, and analyze the imaging metadata."

"Transform our FHIR R4 bundles into analytics-ready tables on Snowflake."

"Analyze FDA FAERS data for adverse events associated with aspirin."

"Design a Phase III clinical trial for a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist
 targeting Type 2 Diabetes with cardiovascular outcome endpoints."

"I have whole-genome sequencing FASTQs. Run variant calling and annotate
 pathogenic variants with ClinVar and gnomAD frequencies."

"Build a retrospective cohort of T2D patients from claims data and
 analyze treatment patterns and medication adherence."

"Build a real-world evidence study: cohort from claims, standardize
 to OMOP, run survival analysis, validate against published literature."
```

### Step 6: Staying Up to Date

This repo is actively developed — new skills, orchestrator improvements, and bug fixes land via PRs to `main`. To pull the latest orchestrator and skills:

```bash
cortex profile sync health-sciences-incubator
```

This syncs both the orchestrator system prompt and all skills from GitHub to your local cache. Re-launch to pick up the changes:

```bash
cortex --profile health-sciences-incubator
```

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `cortex --profile health-sciences-incubator` says "profile not found" | Profile JSON doesn't exist | Follow Step 1 to create `~/.snowflake/cortex/profiles/health-sciences-incubator.json` |
| `/skill` shows no `hcls-*` skills | `skillRepos` not configured or GitHub unreachable | Run `cortex profile show health-sciences-incubator` — should show `Skills (1 repos)` with the GitHub source. If missing, re-create the profile JSON (Step 1). |
| Skills registered but orchestrator doesn't route to them | Profile not active or `systemPromptRepo` misconfigured | Check `systemPromptRepo.source` in profile JSON points to `github:Snowflake-Solutions/health-sciences-coco-skills-incubator/agents/health-sciences-incubator.md`. Clear the cache and re-launch. |
| Skills or orchestrator appear stale after a repo update | Cortex Code is using the cached clone | Run `cortex profile sync health-sciences-incubator` and re-launch |
| `cortex skill list` shows `hcls-*` skills globally | Skills were previously registered via `cortex skill add` | Remove them: `cortex skill remove "github:Snowflake-Solutions/health-sciences-coco-skills-incubator#main"` — the profile's `skillRepos` handles skill loading now |

## Framework Architecture

### Skill Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Router skill** | Detects user intent and routes to specialized sub-skills. Contains setup, preflight checks, and workflow orchestration. | `hcls-provider-imaging`, `hcls-provider-cdata-clinical-docs` |
| **Sub-skill** | Handles one specific task within a router. Loaded by the router, not directly by the user. | `dicom-parser`, `clinical-document-extraction` |
| **Standalone skill** | Self-contained skill with no router or sub-skills. | `hcls-provider-cdata-fhir`, `hcls-pharma-dsafety-pharmacovigilance` |

### CKE (Cortex Knowledge Extensions)

Several skills use **CKE** — dynamically discoverable metadata served via Cortex Search Services. Instead of hardcoding table schemas or document type definitions, skills query a search service at runtime to get the latest metadata.

```
Source of Truth (YAML / Excel)
    │
    └──> Backing Table (in DATA_MODEL_KNOWLEDGE schema)
            │
            └──> Cortex Search Service (CKE)
                    │
                    └──> Skills query at runtime via SEARCH_PREVIEW()
```

This means:
- **Schema changes propagate automatically** — edit the source, refresh the table, the search service updates within its TARGET_LAG
- **Skills are never stale** — they always query the latest metadata
- **Fallback is built in** — if the search service is down, skills fall back to local files on disk

### Router Pattern (DICOM + Clinical Docs)

Both router skills follow the same architecture:

1. **Preflight Check** — probe the CKE search service at skill load (READY / MISSING)
2. **Intent Detection** — classify what the user wants (parse, ingest, search, agent, etc.)
3. **Conditional Step 0** — if CKE is READY, query it for schema/spec context before routing
4. **Sub-skill Loading** — pass grounding context to the sub-skill
5. **Fallback** — if CKE is MISSING, sub-skills use local reference files

### Defense-in-Depth (Clinical Docs)

The clinical documents skill enforces a three-layer guardrail system:

| Layer | Mechanism | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | `AGENTS.md` (profile-level rules) | Session-wide constraints |
| 2 | Gate micro-skills + Phase skills | Structural decomposition — model cannot skip steps |
| 3 | `hooks.json` | Hard blocks on DDL/DML without user confirmation |

Every decision point requires explicit user confirmation via `ask_user_question`. The pipeline is split into **Tier 1 gates** (pre-conditions) and **Tier 2 phases** (execution), with mandatory re-entry between phases.

**Gates (Tier 1 — pre-conditions):**

| Gate | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `confirm-environment` | Validate Snowflake connection, database, schema, warehouse, stage |
| `confirm-doc-types` | Discover and confirm document types to process |
| `confirm-pipeline-config` | Review and approve extraction config before execution |

**Phases (Tier 2 — execution):**

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `parse-and-refresh` | AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT + GENERATE_DYNAMIC_OBJECTS to build/refresh pipeline objects |
| `classify` | AI_COMPLETE-based document classification (single-page and AI_AGG multi-page) |
| `extract` | AI_EXTRACT type-specific field extraction (single-page and AI_AGG multi-page) |

## Skill Naming Convention and Organization

Skills follow a flat directory structure with a structured prefix encoding the taxonomy hierarchy:

```
hcls-{sub-industry}-{function}-{skill}
```

| Component | Values | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `hcls` | Fixed prefix | Health Sciences industry identifier |
| sub-industry | `provider`, `pharma`, `payer`, `cross` | Customer segment |
| function | `imaging`, `cdata`, `dsafety`, `genomics`, `lab`, `claims`, `research`, `cke` | Business function |
| skill | `fhir`, `pharmacovigilance`, `nextflow`, etc. | Use case skill name |

Cortex Code requires skills at exactly **1 level of nesting** from the scan root: `skills/{name}/SKILL.md`. The five-level taxonomy (Industry > Sub-Industry > Business Function > Use Case Skill > Sub-Skill) is encoded in the name prefix, not directory depth.

## Cross-Domain Composition Patterns

The orchestrator composes multiple skills for complex solutions:

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Imaging + Clinical Integration | DICOM parse → FHIR ingest → Clinical NLP → PubMed enrichment → Streamlit |
| Clinical Data Warehouse | FHIR → OMOP CDM → Governance → Semantic views → Dashboards |
| Drug Safety Signal Detection | FAERS analysis → PubMed search → Clinical NLP → Claims correlation → Dashboard |
| Genomics + Clinical Outcomes | nf-core pipeline → Variant annotation → Survival analysis → ML models |
| Single-Cell Analysis Pipeline | scRNA-seq QC → scvi-tools integration → ML Registry |
| Real-World Evidence Study | Claims cohort → Clinical Trials search → OMOP → Survival → PubMed → Dashboard |
| Clinical Trial Design | Problem validation → Trial search → Literature review → Protocol → Power analysis → Feasibility |
| Lab Data Modernization | Allotrope conversion → Dynamic Tables pipeline → Analytics dashboard |
| Clinical Data App (React) | Domain skills → React/Next.js app → SPCS deployment → PHI masking |
| Document Intelligence | Clinical docs extraction → Search → Agent → Governance |
| Fine-Tuned Clinical NLP Pipeline | Industry models (create/verify fine-tuned model) → Clinical NLP normalization (Step 1.5) |

| Sub-Skill | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `clinical-document-extraction` | Orchestrator for the full extraction pipeline (gates + phases) |
| `clinical-docs-search` | Create a Cortex Search Service over parsed content |
| `clinical-docs-agent` | Create a Cortex Agent combining Analyst (Semantic View) + Search |
| `clinical-docs-viewer` | Build a Streamlit document viewer |
| `data-model-knowledge` | Query schema and doc type specs via CKE at runtime |

### CKE Architecture (Dual-Layer)

Clinical docs uses two CKE layers for dynamic metadata discovery:

| CKE Layer | Search Service | Answers |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Schema CKE** | `CLINICAL_DOCS_MODEL_SEARCH_SVC` | "What tables exist?" "Which columns contain PHI?" |
| **Spec CKE** | `CLINICAL_DOCS_SPECS_SEARCH_SVC` | "What fields does a discharge summary have?" "What prompt extracts MRN?" |

```
document_type_specs.yaml (authoritative source of truth)
    │
    ├──> CLINICAL_DOCS_SPECS_REFERENCE table → Spec CKE (search service)
    │
    └──> EXTRACTION_CONFIG table (derived)
            └──> GENERATE_DYNAMIC_OBJECTS() stored procedure
                    ├── Pivot views, Semantic View, refresh task
                    ├── Step 7:  CLINICAL_DOCS_MODEL_REFERENCE → Schema CKE
                    └── Step 7b: CLINICAL_DOCS_SPECS_REFERENCE → Spec CKE
```

### Config-Driven Design

The pipeline is fully config-driven. To add a new document type:

1. Add an entry to `references/document_type_specs.yaml`
2. Seed the config table from the spec (INSERT rows or COPY INTO from CSV)
3. `CALL GENERATE_DYNAMIC_OBJECTS('{db}', '{schema}', '{warehouse}', '{stage}')` — one parameterized call does everything:
   - Config deduplication (removes duplicate rows from repeated loads)
   - Classification + type-specific extraction config seeding
   - Classification prompt update (LISTAGG of all discovered types)
   - New pivot view per doc type
   - MRN_PATIENT_MAPPING view creation
   - Refresh task rebuild with dynamic JOINs to all pivot views
   - Semantic View update (DIMENSIONS + METRICS from config table)
   - Schema CKE + Spec CKE corpus refresh

### Key Reference Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `references/document_type_specs.yaml` | Authoritative doc type definitions (fields, prompts, PHI flags) |
| `references/architecture.md` | Pipeline architecture and design decisions |
| `references/metadata_as_cke.md` | CKE pattern documentation and DICOM comparison |
| `references/cortex_ai_functions.md` | Cortex AI function reference (AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT, AI_EXTRACT, AI_AGG, AI_COMPLETE) |
| `references/supported_document_types.md` | Supported input formats and document type catalog |
| `clinical-document-extraction/scripts/dynamic_pipeline_setup.sql` | All DDL — tables, UDFs, CKE search services, GENERATE_DYNAMIC_OBJECTS proc |
| `clinical-document-extraction/scripts/proc_preprocess_clinical_docs.sql` | Preprocessing — splits large PDFs, populates DOCUMENT_HIERARCHY |
| `clinical-document-extraction/scripts/proc_parse_with_images.sql` | AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT — OCR/layout with optional image extraction |

| `clinical-document-extraction/scripts/stored_procedures.sql` | Modular stored procedure definitions for each pipeline step |

> **Note**: `dynamic_pipeline_setup.sql` is designed for **Snowsight worksheet execution** (single session). It will NOT work with `snow sql -f` due to session variable scoping, nested `$$` delimiters, and EXECUTE IMMEDIATE parsing. For CLI/CoCo execution, decompose into individual steps — see the execution notes in the file header.

## Featured Solution: DICOM Medical Imaging

**Skill**: [`hcls-provider-imaging`](skills/hcls-provider-imaging/)

A comprehensive DICOM imaging solution with an 18-table data model, metadata search, and ML-ready embeddings.

### Sub-Skills

| Sub-Skill | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `dicom-parser` | Parse DICOM file metadata with pydicom, generate DDL from 18-table model |
| `dicom-ingestion` | Build ingestion pipelines (COPY INTO, Dynamic Tables, Streams + Tasks) |
| `dicom-analytics` | Imaging metadata analytics, Cortex Search, radiology NLP |
| `imaging-viewer` | Streamlit DICOM viewer |
| `imaging-governance` | HIPAA compliance, PHI masking, de-identification |
| `imaging-ml` | ML model training and deployment for imaging |
| `data-model-knowledge` | Query the DICOM data model via CKE at runtime |

### CKE Architecture

DICOM uses a single Schema CKE layer:

```
dicom_data_model_reference.xlsx → CSV → DICOM_MODEL_REFERENCE table
                                            → DICOM_MODEL_SEARCH_SVC (Cortex Search)
```

Sub-skills query the search service for table definitions, column types, DICOM tag mappings, and PHI indicators. DDL can be generated dynamically using `CORTEX.COMPLETE()` grounded by search results.

---

## Featured Solution: Clinical NLP

**Skill**: [`hcls-provider-cdata-clinical-nlp`](skills/hcls-provider-cdata-clinical-nlp/)

A GenAI-powered clinical NLP pipeline that extracts structured entities from unstructured clinical notes and normalizes them to standard terminologies — all running on Snowflake via Cortex AI COMPLETE, Dynamic Tables, and stored procedures.

### What It Does

```
Clinical Notes (discharge summaries, progress notes, H&Ps)
    → Extraction Dynamic Tables (Cortex COMPLETE per concept category)
        → Conditions, Therapeutics, Observations,
           Patient Context, Oncology, Safety/Care Planning
    → Normalization Stored Procedure (exact match + fine-tuned model + Cortex fuzzy)
        → ICD-10-CM, SNOMED CT, RxNorm, LOINC, MedDRA, ICD-O-3
    → Governance (PHI masking, de-identification, audit)
```

### Sub-Skills

| Sub-Skill | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|
| `extraction-conditions-diagnostics` | Conditions, diagnoses, symptoms, risk factors |
| `extraction-therapeutics` | Medications, procedures, allergies |
| `extraction-observations` | Labs, vitals, exam findings, scores |
| `extraction-patient-context` | Social history, family history |
| `extraction-oncology` | Cancer staging, TNM, biomarkers |
| `extraction-safety-care-planning` | Adverse events, care plans, referrals |
| `normalization-conditions-diagnostics` | ICD-10-CM / SNOMED CT mapping |
| `normalization-therapeutics` | RxNorm / CPT mapping |
| `normalization-observations` | LOINC mapping |
| `normalization-patient-context` | Z-code / SDOH mapping |
| `normalization-oncology` | ICD-O-3 mapping |
| `normalization-safety-care-planning` | MedDRA mapping |
| `governance` | PHI masking, de-identification, audit trails, role setup |
| `pipeline-implementation` | Production pipeline (6 extraction DTs + normalization SP) |
| `data-model-knowledge` | CKE: schema reference via Cortex Search |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Extraction is code-system-agnostic** — captures text spans only; codes are NULL until normalization
- **Terminology Preference Gate** — for any normalization intent, the router asks the user which code system(s) to use before proceeding
- **Normalization tiers** — exact match → optional fine-tuned model (via `hcls-cross-aiml-industrymodels`) → Cortex COMPLETE fuzzy match (with confidence scores)
- **Single best code per entity** — one entity = one row = one code (no duplicate rows for different code systems)

### CKE Architecture

Clinical NLP uses a single Schema CKE layer:

```
clinical_nlp_model_search_corpus.csv → CLINICAL_NLP_MODEL_REFERENCE table
                                            → CLINICAL_NLP_MODEL_SEARCH_SVC (Cortex Search)
```

Sub-skills query the search service for table definitions, column types, and FHIR mappings. DDL and extraction prompts can be grounded by search results.

## Agent Profiles

Two orchestrator profiles in `agents/` control which skills are available and how requests are routed:

| Profile | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Incubator** | `health-sciences-incubator.md` | All skills enabled — rapid prototyping, demos, and development |
| **Production** | `health-sciences-solutions.md` | Production-grade skills only — skills graduate here after validation |

Profiles include routing rules (by sub-industry and task type), cross-domain composition patterns, CKE integration guidance, and HIPAA guardrails.

### How Profiles Work

Each profile is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`) that serves as a system prompt for Cortex Code. When you activate a profile via `/agents`, Cortex Code loads the system prompt and uses the routing rules inside it to direct your requests to the appropriate skill.

### Configuration Files

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Profile JSON | `~/.snowflake/cortex/profiles/<profile-name>.json` | Defines the profile metadata, skill repos (GitHub source), and system prompt repo (GitHub source). Skills and orchestrator declared here are **scoped to this profile only**. |
| Agent Markdown | `agents/<profile-name>.md` (in this repo) | The orchestrator system prompt with routing rules and skill taxonomy. Fetched automatically from GitHub via `systemPromptRepo` — no local copy needed. |
| `skills.json` | `~/.snowflake/cortex/skills.json` | Global skill registry — **not used** for profile-scoped skills. Only relevant if you add skills via `cortex skill add` for other purposes. |

### Switching Between Profiles

Use `/agents` in Cortex Code to list and switch between registered profiles. Only one profile is active at a time.

## Skill Development Lifecycle

This repo is the **incubator** in a two-repo model:

```
Snowflake-Solutions/health-sciences-coco-skills-incubator    ← THIS REPO (Phase 0 & 1)
        │
        │  Skills mature here, then graduate ↓
        │
Snowflake-Solutions/cortex-code-skills           ← SFS production repo (Phase 2)
```

| Phase | Repo | Who | What |
|-------|------|-----|------|
| **Phase 0: Setup** | This repo (incubator) | Tiger Team | Create repo, guidelines, profile, orchestrator |
| **Phase 1: Incubate** | This repo (incubator) | Anyone (SEs, SAs, field) | Branch from main, develop skills, raise PR to merge |
| **Phase 2: Harden** | SFS cortex-code-skills | Tiger Team only | Audit, test, promote: draft → review → staging → production |
| **Phase 3: Publish** | Snowflake registry | Tiger Team | `cortex profile publish` production profile for field teams |
| **Phase 4: Consume** | Field environments | Field teams | `cortex profile add health-sciences-solutions -c <connection>` |

### Adding a New Skill

A contributor creates their skill directory under `skills/` and then refreshes the orchestrator so it can route to the new skill. This workflow is designed to become a skill itself — ask the orchestrator to "add a new skill" and it walks through these steps automatically.

1. Create the skill directory following the naming convention: `skills/hcls-{sub}-{func}-{skill}/`
2. Add `SKILL.md` with proper frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`)
3. Register the skill in `templates/skills_incubator.yaml` (triggers, description, domain, and any sub-skills or CKE metadata)
4. Regenerate the orchestrator:
   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_orchestrators.py --profile incubator
   ```
5. Verify `agents/health-sciences-incubator.md` includes the new skill in the taxonomy tree and routing tables
6. Commit the skill directory, registry update, and regenerated orchestrator

For router skills with sub-skills, see `hcls-provider-cdata-clinical-docs/` or `hcls-provider-imaging/` as templates.

### Branch and Pull Request Workflow

All changes to this repo follow a **branch-driven** workflow. Contributors branch from `main`, develop and test on their branch, then raise a pull request to merge back into `main`.

```
main (stable, curated)
  │
  ├── feature/hcls-payer-claims-adjudication   ← contributor branch
  │       └── PR #12 → review → merge to main
  │
  ├── fix/imaging-preflight-check              ← bug fix branch
  │       └── PR #15 → review → merge to main
  │
  └── feature/hcls-pharma-lab-mass-spec        ← new skill branch
          └── PR #18 → review → merge to main
```

**Branch naming conventions:**

| Prefix | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `feature/hcls-{name}` | New skill or major enhancement |
| `fix/{description}` | Bug fix to existing skill |
| `docs/{description}` | Documentation-only changes |
| `refactor/{description}` | Restructuring without behavior change |

**Workflow:**

1. Branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/hcls-payer-claims-adjudication`
2. Develop your skill following the [Adding a New Skill](#adding-a-new-skill) steps
3. Test locally: `cortex skill add ./health-sciences-coco-skills-incubator/skills`
4. Push your branch: `git push -u origin feature/hcls-payer-claims-adjudication`
5. Open a pull request targeting `main`
6. Address review feedback
7. Tiger Team merges after approval

**Key properties:**
- `main` is always the latest curated state — field teams always point to `main`
- No milestone tags or version numbers — PRs gate what gets into `main`
- Contributors never push directly to `main`
